# Personal Portfolio Website

## Purpose 
I did this project to create a website that can showcase a little but about myself as well as some of the projects that I have completed. I learned a great deal about the NextJS framework as well as HTML and CSS while working on this project. I would like for this to be something that I can continue to work on and improve as I gain more experience and create new projects. 


## Tech Stack 
NextJS framework to build the project. Vanilla CSS for styling. Framer Motion library for animations.
